Introduction
=====
This app is a workout and fitness platform where users can dynamically build workouts and post them to their friends' feeds. It aims to promote motivation, consistency, and social engagement in fitness routines.

Requirements Gathering
=====
To ensure our application aligns with the needs of our target users, we carried out a structured requirements elicitation process. This helped us gather insights directly from potential users and shape the feature set around their actual goals and preferences.

Elicitation Methods
=====
User Interviews: We conducted interviews with fitness enthusiasts, asking them what they would want from a mobile application for posting workouts to their friends.

These insights revealed a common interest in maintaining motivation through social sharing and having a flexible system for tracking gym activities. As a result, the app's main focus is to allow users to post their workouts for friends to see, helping promote an active lifestyle.

Key Features
=====
Custom Activity Logging:
Users can add any type of activity they’ve completed in the gym — including weightlifting, cardio, yoga, or meditation.

Dynamic Workout Creation:
Activities can be grouped into a personalized workout session, allowing users to build their own structured routines.

Social Workout Sharing:
Once a workout is created, it can be posted to the user’s feed, making it visible to all their friends on the platform.

Friend Feed Interaction:
Users can view, like, and comment on friends’ workouts to encourage engagement and motivation.
