Introduction
============
This app is a workout/fitness platform where users can dynamicly build workouts and post them to their friends feeds.

Requirements Gathering
To ensure our application aligns with the needs of our target users, we carried out a structured requirements elicitation process. This helped us gather insights directly from potential users and shape the feature set around their actual goals and preferences.

Elicitation Methods
We used a combination of the following methods:

User Interviews: We had conducted interviews with fitness enthusiasts, asking them what they would want from an mobile application for posting workouts to their friends. 

Our app's main focus is to allow users to post their workouts for friends to see, maintaing motivation to keep going to the gym and a active lifestyle.


Key features / goals
Custom Activity Logging
Users can add any type of activity they’ve completed in the gym — whether it’s weightlifting, cardio, yoga or meditation.

Dynamic Workout Creation
Activities can be grouped into a personalized workout session, allowing users to build their own structured workouts.

Social Workout Sharing
Once a workout is created, it can be posted to the user’s feed, making it visible to all their friends on the platform.

Friend Feed Interaction (optional to include)
Users can view, like, and comment on friends’ workouts to encourage engagement and motivation.
