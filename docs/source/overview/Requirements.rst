Requirements Gathering
=====
To ensure our application aligns with the needs of our target users, we carried out a structured requirements elicitation process. This helped us gather insights directly from potential users and shape the feature set around their actual goals and preferences.

Elicitation Methods
=====
User Interviews: We conducted interviews with fitness enthusiasts, asking them what they would want from a mobile application for posting workouts to their friends.

These insights revealed a common interest in maintaining motivation through social sharing and having a flexible system for tracking gym activities. As a result, the app's main focus is to allow users to post their workouts for friends to see, helping promote an active lifestyle.

Key Features
=====
Custom Activity Logging:
Users can add any type of activity they’ve completed in the gym — including weightlifting, cardio, yoga, or meditation.

Dynamic Workout Creation:
Activities can be grouped into a personalized workout session, allowing users to build their own structured routines.

Social Workout Sharing:
Once a workout is created, it can be posted to the user’s feed, making it visible to all their friends on the platform.

Friend Feed Interaction:
Users can view, like, and comment on friends’ workouts to encourage engagement and motivation.
